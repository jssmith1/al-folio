#### Student Evaluations: 
4.8 / 5 (Department Average: 4.0 / 5)

> * "Mr. Smith was very excited about the material and was always in a good mood."
> * "He very clearly explains difficult concepts and makes an effort to explain things in different ways for students who are having trouble understanding."
> * "Excellent teacher, clearly invested and interested in the subject itself"
> * "He explains the concepts in intuitive terms. If a student doesn't understand a concept he will approach it from a different angle rather than just repeating the notes. He also interacts with the class at all times, keeping the class engaging."
