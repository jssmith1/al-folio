I am an Assitant Professor of Computer Science at Lafayette College. I earned my PhD in Computer Science from North Carolina State University in 2019, where I studied under the advisement of [Dr. Emerson Murphy-Hill](https://ai.google/research/people/EmersonMurphyHill) and [Dr. Kathryn Stolee](http://kstolee.github.io/). Previously, I have interned at Microsoft Research, ABB Research, and IBM. Now I live in the New York City area with my wife, Emma, and our cat, Butter. My research focuses on the intersections between Software Engineering, HCI, and Security. I study the human aspects of Software Engineering. This can range anywhere from how developers get help from online Q&A sites like Stack Overflow, to the factors that influence ethical decision making in software development. My dissertation explores how software developers interact with security vulnerabilities in their source code. Please reach out if you would like to collaborate or talk more about my research! 

**Spring 2020 Office Hours**: T/Th 3:15-4:15pm; F 1-2pm.
