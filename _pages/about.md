I am a PhD candidtate in the department of Computer Science at North Carolina State University, which I joined in summer 2014. My research focuses primarily on the intersection of Software Engineering, HCI, and Security. I study the human aspects of Software Engineering. This can range anywhere from how developers get help from online Q&A sites like Stack Overflow, to the factors that influence ethical decision making in software development. My dissertation explores how software developers interact with security vulnerabilities in their source code. I study under the advisement of [Dr. Emerson Murphy-Hill](https://people.engr.ncsu.edu/ermurph3/index.html) and [Dr. Kathryn Stolee](http://kstolee.github.io/).
