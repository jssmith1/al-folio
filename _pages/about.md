I am a 5th year PhD candidtate in the department of Computer Science at North Carolina State University. Previously, I have interned at Microsoft Research, ABB Research, and IBM. Now I live in the New York City area, where I am seeking full-time opportunities and wrapping up my dissertation. My research focuses on the intersections between Software Engineering, HCI, and Security. I study the human aspects of Software Engineering. This can range anywhere from how developers get help from online Q&A sites like Stack Overflow, to the factors that influence ethical decision making in software development. My dissertation explores how software developers interact with security vulnerabilities in their source code. My co-advisors are [Dr. Emerson Murphy-Hill](https://people.engr.ncsu.edu/ermurph3/index.html) and [Dr. Kathryn Stolee](http://kstolee.github.io/). Please reach out if you would like to collaborate or talk more about my research!
