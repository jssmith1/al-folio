  abstract={Security vulnerabilities are often accidentally introduced as developers implement code. While there are a variety of existing tools to help detect security vulnerabilities, they are seldom used by developers due to the time or security expertise required. We are investigating techniques integrated within the IDE to help developers detect and mitigate security vulnerabilities. In previous work, we examined the questions developers ask when investigating security vulnerabilities with static analysis tools. With those questions as a lens, we now investigate our proposed approach of interactive static analysis. We evaluated the interactions and perceptions of professional developers as they interacted with warnings produced by our tool. Our results provide evidence that our approach effectively communicates security vulnerability information to software developers and provides design guidance for such tools.}
